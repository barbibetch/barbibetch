- 👋 Hi, I’m @barbibetch
- 👀 I am looking for like-minded people who take me seriously. I am able to build connections with those who feel commited to my cause. I am totally REAL, get it. ;)
- 🌱 I am learning more about the world every single day. It is an endless mystery. I always wonder what I can do with my voice.
- 💞️ I love people, especially like-minded women (men too) that have a cause they want to bring to the table. I could be an excellent attorney, I know the law.
- 📫 How to reach me ... mtrcorbin@gmail.com, or my personal number, if you wanna ask. I'd be flattered, truly.
